# House Price Prediction Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a process for predicting house prices using the Kaggle House Prices dataset. The notebook covers data loading, exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training with LightGBM, hyperparameter tuning, making predictions, and analyzing feature importances.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the sale price of houses based on a variety of features. The dataset provides detailed information about residential homes in Ames, Iowa, covering aspects like location, size, quality, and other relevant characteristics.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook (`house_price_prediction.ipynb`) is structured into the following sections:

1.  **Load the datasets**: Loading the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files into pandas DataFrames.
2.  **Explore the data**: Initial data exploration to understand the structure, identify missing values, and analyze the distribution of key features, including the target variable (`SalePrice`).
3.  **Handle missing values**: Strategies for addressing missing values through column dropping and imputation.
4.  **Handle categorical features**: Encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding.
5.  **Handle numerical features**: Addressing numerical features through scaling and transformations.
6.  **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new, potentially informative features from existing ones.
7.  **Prepare data for modeling**: Final preparation of the training and testing dataframes for machine learning models.
8.  **Train LightGBM Model**: Training an initial LightGBM regression model.
9.  **Make Predictions and Evaluate**: Making predictions on the test set and outlining evaluation considerations.
10. **Generate Submission File**: Generating a submission file in the specified format.
11. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Performing hyperparameter tuning on the LightGBM model using GridSearchCV and cross-validation.
12. **Evaluate the Tuned Model**: Evaluating the performance of the model with the best hyperparameters.
13. **Make predictions with Tuned Model**: Making predictions on the test set using the tuned model.
14. **Generate Submission File with Tuned Model**: Creating a submission file with the tuned model's predictions.
15. **Analyze Feature Importances**: Analyzing and visualizing the importance of different features in the tuned model.

## Key Steps and Techniques Used

*   **Data Loading and Exploration**: Using pandas to load and get a preliminary understanding of the data.
*   **Missing Value Handling**: Employing strategies to deal with missing data points to ensure data quality.
*   **Categorical Feature Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
*   **Numerical Feature Scaling and Transformation**: Applying techniques like StandardScaler and log transformation to handle feature distributions and scales.
*   **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features like house age, years since remodel, total square feet, and total bathrooms to potentially improve model performance.
*   **Model Training**: Utilizing the LightGBM algorithm, a gradient boosting framework known for its efficiency and performance.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV with cross-validation to find the optimal hyperparameters for the LightGBM model.
*   **Prediction and Submission**: Generating predictions on the unseen test data and creating a submission file.
*   **Feature Importance Analysis**: Gaining insights into which features the trained model considered most important for predicting house prices.
